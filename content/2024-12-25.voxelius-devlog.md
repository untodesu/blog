This is a collection of public test release notes for Voxelius 0.0.1.2453.
The entire release has been cobbled together in practically a day after I
realized how much of a mess-up was my itch.io username and identity
implementation.  

## Messed up the tree. Again.
After all that dynamically-linked dependency fiasco (which was objectively a bad
idea to pull into the project in the frist place, oh well), I tried to prune all
the DLL/SO files tracked by LFS and somehow ended up with about 60 dangling
commits, and since GitHub doesn't periodically call `git gc` anymore, the only
logical solution was to start from a blank slate. Again. All the GitHub stars
are gone and all the badges broke for like two hours while I was figuring out
moving code from one tree to another.  

## New-old server password system
After a short discussion in "The Linux Space" Discord server, I decided to use
server-based password storage instead; this introduced a few new things to the
server-side configuration

### The server password
A generic way to access a semi-private server. Players should be able to join
only when they know this specific password and will be kicked if the password
string is not equal to the server-side value. To set the server password, locate
to your `server.conf` file, open it in a text editor, locate to a line (or add a
new line if it doesn't exist) that defines `game.password` variable and change
it to the following (replace `%PASSWORD%` with your own thing):  

```
game.password = %PASSWORD%
```

If you want to enter an empty password (in other words, _disable_ password
logins for players), just leave an empty space after the equal sign.  

On the client side of things, the server browser edit mode has gained a new
input field to the right of the server address field:

And when you try to join a server with an incorrect password, the server kicks
you with this kind of message:

### The whitelist
A minecraft-like way of allowing who can play on a server has been implemented;
to enable the whitelist, locate to your `server.conf` file, open it in a text
editor, locate to a line (or add a new line if it doesn't exist) that defines
`whitelist.enabled` and change it to the following:

```
whitelist.enabled = true
```

This will enable the whitelist and use the default whitelist filename which is
currently defined as just `whitelist.txt`, so create a new file and just list
different usernames you want to allow to the server. Additionally, if you want
to specify per-player password, add a colon and specify a password after it:  

```
untodesu
pqcraft:custom_password
```

The first line will allow a player with the username `untodesu` to connect to
the server using default server password (`game.password`), while the second
line will allow a player with the username `pqcraft` to connect to the server
only using a `custom_password` as a password.

## The hotbar
Since I consider previous release a part of this one, I shall also mention
things added in that release as well. A new hotbar HUD element has been added
to add visual feedback on what voxel the player is going to place. Currently
nothing is rendered inside its slots and the hotbar items are only filled in
whenever `ENABLE_EXPERIMENTS` is defined in the build config.

## The voxel registry
I completely nuked JSON voxel definitions in favor of a more programmer-friendly
approach of using the good old time-tested builder pattern:  

```c++
game_voxels::grass = vdef::construct("grass", VoxelType::Cube, false, false)
  .add_texture_default("textures/voxels/grass_side_01.png")
  .add_texture_default("textures/voxels/grass_side_02.png")
  .add_texture(VoxelFace::CubeBottom, "textures/voxels/dirt_01.png")
  .add_texture(VoxelFace::CubeBottom, "textures/voxels/dirt_02.png")
  .add_texture(VoxelFace::CubeBottom, "textures/voxels/dirt_03.png")
  .add_texture(VoxelFace::CubeBottom, "textures/voxels/dirt_04.png")
  .add_texture(VoxelFace::CubeTop, "textures/voxels/grass_01.png")
  .add_texture(VoxelFace::CubeTop, "textures/voxels/grass_02.png")
  .build();
```

## Resource management
I implemented a new resource management system that uses C++ reference-counted
objects (`std::shared_ptr<T>`) to maintain resources. Currently the only things
using it are images, 2D textures and binary files (which are used for the now
memory-resident TTF font files):

```c++
if(auto image = resource::load<Image>("textures/gui/window_icon.png")) {
    GLFWimage icon = {};
    icon.width = image->width;
    icon.height = image->height;
    icon.pixels = reinterpret_cast<unsigned char *>(image->pixels);

    glfwSetWindowIcon(globals::window, 1, &icon);
}
```

## Bug fixes
* Fixed a bug when changing world seed for debug session didnâ€™t update
heightmaps of the world generator (thanks PuZ-ZaN);  
* Fixed inconsistent epoch time values produced on Windows systems (changed
`high_resolution_clock` to `system_clock` which seems to be implemented using
FILETIME on WinNT and automatically fixes the issue);  
* A bunch of miscellaneous bug-fixes that I don't even remember because there's
usually a lot of them;
