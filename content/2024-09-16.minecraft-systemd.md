> **NOTE:** This tutorial expects you to know your basics of working with a remote Linux server via [SSH](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=ssh+tutorial) and most importantly have a remote server to SSH into; I also expect you to be mentally capable to deal with both systemd and java antics.  

Recently, the VPS I host my Minecraft SMP on, has been upgraded and the owner decided to revise the way they share it with the people currently using it; instead of all the users sharing a single environment (and having no root access which calls for using <a target="_self" href="2023-08-30.crontab-automation.html">quirky ways of automation</a>) now everyone is given a separate virtual container and have network ports remapped with a prefix (example: outside port 15443 maps to port 443 in the container).  

Because using crontab is no longer required, I decided to re-setup NRMC's automation using stuff that systemd provides and share it here with everyone else.  

## Creating a directory
By default (and I have no idea if this is patchable) systemd prevents any service from touching stuff anywhere near the `/home/` directory, so instead we will be using a different dedicated path in the `/srv/` which makes more sense than `/home/`:  
```text
# mkdir -p /srv/minecraft
```

After that you have to copy all the necessary files like a server JAR, configs and really anything else your admincraft heart desires. This can be done by either using an [SFTP client](https://filezilla-project.org/) or downloading files from the terminal using either [curl](https://curl.se/) or [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/).  

## Creating a dummy user
Running the service as root may result in an [accident](https://github.com/MrMEEE/bumblebee-Old-and-abbandoned/issues/123), so we create a separate user for the server:  
```text
# useradd -d /srv/minecraft -s /sbin/nologin minecraft
```

This will create a `minecraft` user that is not able to login and has home directory set to `/srv/minecraft` which we dedicated for the Minecraft server.  

Now that the user is created and files are copied, it's a good idea to recursively transfer ownership of the directory to the dedicated user:  
```text
# chown -R minecraft:minecraft /srv/minecraft
```

## Stuffing commands
Because there is no longer a GNU screen session to stuff input commands into, now we use systemd's socket units to define a FIFO file which is then linked with the server's standard input.  

#### File: [`systemd/minecraft.socket`](https://github.com/untodesu/nrmc/blob/c85ffa2f4774c8344c16d9ad905a8568f4903f09/systemd/minecraft.socket)
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Minecraft Server STDIN [NRMC]
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Socket]
ListenFIFO=%t/minecraft-stdin.fifo
Service=minecraft.service
```

Then running a command is as simple as piping output to a file:  
```text
$ echo "say this is a test" > /run/minecraft-stdin.fifo
```

## Daemonizing
The service file defines what to run, what user-group ID pair to use and generally what environment the service is supposed to have. This includes piping standard input socket into the process.  

#### File: [`systemd/minecraft.service`](https://github.com/untodesu/nrmc/blob/c85ffa2f4774c8344c16d9ad905a8568f4903f09/systemd/minecraft.service)
```ini
[Unit]
Description=Minecraft Server [NRMC]
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=minecraft
Group=minecraft
WorkingDirectory=/srv/minecraft
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -Xms1024M -Xmx4096M -XX:ActiveProcessorCount=4 -jar paper-1.20.4-497.jar --nogui --universe save
Sockets=minecraft.socket
StandardInput=socket
StandardOutput=journal
StandardError=journal
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Daemon updates
Because the server scripts and configs are [open-source](https://github.com/untodesu/nrmc) I needed a simple way to edit a daemon file in the repository root, then apply changes and do a system-wide daemon reload. This script does exactly what I need:  

#### File: [`systemd/update.sh`](https://github.com/untodesu/nrmc/blob/c85ffa2f4774c8344c16d9ad905a8568f4903f09/systemd/update.sh)
```sh
#!/bin/bash
cd $(realpath $(dirname ${0}))
cp ${PWD}/minecraft.service /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.service
cp ${PWD}/minecraft.socket /etc/systemd/system/minecraft.socket
systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Announcements
The server is scheduled to restart every day, so there needs to be a way of warning the users half an hour in advance. The script to send a visual and audible message runs the following Minecraft JE commands:  

```text
execute at @a run playsound mineraft:item.goat_horn.sound.1 ambient @p ~ ~ ~ 10 1
say <announcement text>
title @a reset
title @a subtitle "<announcement text>"
title @a title ""
```

> **NOTE:** the `playsound` command is broken for some reason which requires testing. I only noticed this because I helped a bloke at work to set up his SMP using my scripts. For some reason it was working just fine before the systemd migration?  

These commands reset the title, print a text, play a sound and display the same exact text as a subtitle. The announcement looks like this:

#### File: [`systemd/announce.sh`](https://github.com/untodesu/nrmc/blob/c85ffa2f4774c8344c16d9ad905a8568f4903f09/systemd/announce.sh)
```sh
#!/bin/sh
printf "%s\n" "execute at @a run playsound mineraft:item.goat_horn.sound.1 ambient @p ~ ~ ~ 10 1" > /run/minecraft-stdin.fifo
printf "%s\n" "say ${*}" > /run/minecraft-stdin.fifo
printf "%s\n" "title @a reset" > /run/minecraft-stdin.fifo
printf "%s\n" "title @a subtitle \"${*}\"" > /run/minecraft-stdin.fifo
printf "%s\n" "title @a title \"\"" > /run/minecraft-stdin.fifo
```

## You cannot escape crontab
The server is still supposed to restart every day, so a bunch of cron jobs is necessary:  

```text
30 19 * * * /srv/minecraft/systemd/announce.sh Server restart in 30 minutes
45 19 * * * /srv/minecraft/systemd/announce.sh Server restart in 15 minutes
55 19 * * * /srv/minecraft/systemd/announce.sh Server restart in 5 minutes
59 19 * * * /srv/minecraft/systemd/announce.sh Server restart in 1 minute
00 20 * * * /usr/bin/systemctl restart minecraft.service
```
