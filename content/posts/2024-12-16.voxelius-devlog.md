## Bug fixes
* Fixed single-player sessions failing to generate new chunks after pressing "cancel" while connecting to an unreachable remote server (thanks PQCraft);  
* General fixes and improvements related to the source code tree and shared game code;  

## Networking
* Protocol version number has been bumped to 10; all servers currently running on an older version of the game are recommended to be updated to 0.0.1.2451;  
* Added a new network packet sent by clients to request a chunk to be transmitted to them; subsequently the entire visibility check system has been implemented to support this specific packet;  

## Rendering
* Both client and server now load worlds much faster because there is no longer a period of time at which the game just chews through chunks to generate; now all the chunks are generated on-demand which should drastically improve loading and rendering performance;  

## World
* Introduced a simple chunk storage format to make player activity persistent throughout server restarts;  
* The world chunks are only saved if there has been player activity in them which is any kind of voxel change;
