Because you The Reader can host your own Voxelius server anywhere at any time, I decided to publically showcase how is the public test server being operated and also provide a bunch of scenarios in which additional setup can be needed.  

> **NOTE:** this tutorial is focused on setting up a Voxelius server using systemd services and as a consequence is for Linux only; if you're hosting a public server on Windows (how perverted!), you'd have to do things yourself!  

## Prerequisites
* A server running a Linux distribution that uses [systemd](https://systemd.io/)  
* Access to the server console (for remote/monitor-less servers SSH is the industry standard, but you can also just slap a dumb terminal to an RS-232 port and use it to set the server up, I'm not your mom)  
* Basic knowledge of Linux administration and Linux filesystem hierarchy  

## Filesystem hierarchy
For some reason, systemd freaks out whenever the running user's home directory is touched in any way, but only when the directory resides in `/home/`, so we're not going to run the server from there and instead make a new directory in `/opt/` which, according to FHS, hosts applications that do not necessarily follow FHS/UNIX filesystem hierarchy and store things however they want:  

```text
# mkdir -o /opt/voxelius
```

For the sake of general safety, we need a specific user to run the server as; and because we don't really need to login as that user, we set their shell to be `/sbin/nologin` which immediately ends a session as soon as the user logs in:  

```text
# useradd -d /opt/voxelius -s /sbin/nologin voxelius
```

Now we transfer ownership of the directory to the pseudo-user:  

```text
# chown -R voxelius:voxelius /opt/voxelius
```

Then, `sudo` into the user (_NOTE:_ this requires `sudo` to be installed, and if it isn't, please ensure to install it with your system's package manager)  

```text
# sudo -u voxelius -s ${SHELL}
$ cd /opt/voxelius
```

## Downloading binaries
On a desktop, navigate to [https://github.com/untolabs/voxelius/releases](https://github.com/untolabs/voxelius/releases) and go to the latest available release, then copy the download link for a zip archive that ends with your preferred platform and CPU architecture

![](posts/2024-12-26.voxelius-server-tutorial/screenshot-release.png)  

Then, on the server, navigate to `/opt/voxelius/` and download your chosen binary release archive (_NOTE:_ this requires `wget` to be installed, and if it isn't, please ensure to install it with your system's package manager)  

```text
$ wget https://github.com/untolabs/voxelius/releases/download/0.0.1.2453/voxelius-0.0.1.2453-linux64.zip
```

Unpack the archive (_NOTE:_ this requires `unzip` to be installed, and if it isn't, please ensure to install it with your system's package manager)  

```text
$ unzip voxelius-0.0.1.2453-linux64.zip
```

> **NOTE:** if you're using this tutorial to upgrade the existing server and you were also using this tutorial to set it up in the first place, the directory `/opt/voxelius/server` should already exist, so make sure to rename it to something that the service script won't touch, like `/opt/voxelius/server.old`  

Rename the unpacked directory and name it `server`  

```text
$ mv voxelius-0.0.1.2453-linux64 server
```

Exit the pseudo-user session by typing `exit` and pressing ENTER, or use a keyboard shortcut Ctrl+D to send EOF and terminate the session this way;  

## Service script
Create a file `/etc/systemd/system/voxelius-server.service` with the following contents:  

```ini
[Unit]
Description=Voxelius Server
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
User=voxelius
Group=voxelius
WorkingDirectory=/opt/voxelius/server
ExecStart=/opt/voxelius/server/vserver --use-syslog --verbose --userpath /opt/voxelius/instance
Restart=always
RestartSec=30

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

The script would run the server and set its write path to `/opt/voxelius/instance`; the write path (user path) is a location to which the client/server executable will save things like configuration, world saves and other things. By default it should be located in `/opt/voxelius/.voxelius` but I don't feel like it's a good place for a server.  

Refresh the daemon cache:  

```text
# systemctl daemon-reload
```

Start and enable the server:

```text
# systemctl enable --now voxelius-server.service
```

Observe server logs in real-time:  
```text
# journalctl -fu voxelius-server.service
```

## Updating configuration
Stop the server:  

```text
# systemctl stop voxelius-server.service
```

The server has created a configuration file located at `/opt/voxelius/instance/server.conf` and it should look somewhat like this:  

```ini
game.password =
game.listen_port = 43103
game.status_peers = 4
game.view_distance = 8
worldgen.seed = 42
sessions.max_players = 16
whitelist.filename = whitelist.txt
whitelist.enabled = false
server.tickrate = 30
```

And here's a list of all the options you can edit:  

* `game.password`: sets global server access password; if whitelist is enabled, entries without a password set will use this value as a password for connecting;  
* `game.listen_port`: the UDP port the game server listens for connections on and clients use to connect to the server; the game doesn't allow ports below 1024;  
* `game.status_peers`: the amount of available peer slots to receive status requests;  
* `game.view_distance`: a quote-unoquote "RADIUS" in chunks in which server-bound chunk request packets are accepted and responded to with a loaded chunk;  
* `worldgen.seed`: world generator seed (I think it's unused and just found its way into release config by mistake, my apologies);  
* `sessions.max_players`: the amount of available peer slots for client sessions;  
* `whitelist.filename`: sets the filename at which the server looks for whitelist entries; ignored when `whitelist.enabled` is false;  
* `whitelist.enabled`: sets whether to use whitelist to filter out players or not;  
* `server.tickrate`: the server will try to simulate the world at this rate;  

## The whitelist
If you want to only allow players with specific usernames to connect to the server, set `whitelist.enabled` to true and create a new file named `whitelist.txt` in the same directory as the server config (if you changed `whitelist.filename` then use that instead of the default path).  

Here's an example of a server whitelist; I will explain it line-by-line below:  

```text
pqcraft:gaspassword
untodesu
```

This whitelist allows only two players (`untodesu` and `pqcraft`) to connect; while the player named `untodesu` can connect to the server using the global password (that is set by `game.password` value in config), the player named `pqcraft` can only connect to the server using `gaspassword` as a password string.  

## Finishing up
After you're done tinkering with configuration, start the server again and ensure your server can actually listen on the UDP port you chose (might be a matter of opening a port in your hosting provider's dashboard or, if you self-host, might be a matter of opening up your router's control panel and setting up some port forwarding rules)
