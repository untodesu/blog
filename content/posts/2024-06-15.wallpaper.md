Originally posted in Discord, there was a newer version that is now lost media. I also managed to recover a blender [project](posts/2024-06-15.wallpaper/WP0.blend) with a semi-comprehensive version of the wallpaper; versions might differ and the project file may be messed up in newer versions of blender!!!
