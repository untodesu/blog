> Big appreciation to [BGVC](https://bg123.gitlab.io) for their VHS filter; I would've used mine (RITEG) but it seemed like a better idea to just use something that is already integrated into Blender's compositing pipeline  

As with all my 3D renders of wallpapers of all sort, I just sat down and had a strike of incredible focusing potential. Now it's 02:50 AM and I have to wake up to go to work tomorrow, but at least I have cool-looking renders:
