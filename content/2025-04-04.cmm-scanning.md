One day I was asked by a bloke at work to explain how scanning works from the hardware point of view. So I drew them a diagram; after some time I decided it's not worth it to keep it private and decided to make a small blog post that contains an abridged explanation of how scanning works.  

So here's the diagram:

- Basically, the CMM starts by looking up a surface at _Ps_ point  
- After that, it begins moving in the direction of _Vd_  
- Whilst moving, the probe head detects changes in "altitude" and calls back to the positioning system to either raise or lower the probe itself  
- While doing this, the CMM's brains (or an I++ DME server for what one is concerned) decimate and accumulate data with _StepW_ as an average distance between two points. Mind you, if you specify zero for that value, DME server is going to dump literally anything it gets without any filtering  
- Also the brains control when to stop. In the image, I drew a plane (projected to the screen as a line, there is a point _Pe_ that is _on the plane_ and the plane is oriented at _Ve_). When the read probe position crosses this boundary a set amount of times, the command is considered finished.  

I might be wrong. I am not a metrology specialist. And I am definitely not smart enough to figure it out in full :D
