description: A bunch of quality-of-life changes
tags: development, voxelius

## General changes
* New versioning scheme. Public tests now specify last two digits of the year
and week number in the tweak version. So this new release is version 0.0.1 with
a public test for week 50 of year 2024;  
* Experimental single-player support; new C++ API for managing an SP session
has been also implemented for all the GUI things that might want the player to
join or leave a game world;  

## Protocol improvements
* Protocol V9 no longer has a server password field in the Login Request packet;  
* The aforementioned Login Request packet’s fields are now used in full; both
client and server validate their VDef2 (voxel registry) integrity;  

## New voxels
* Glass. That’s it; it is rendered semi-correctly now. Specifically for glass,
I added a special option to disable depth-sorting chunk meshes that might speed
things up on lower-end machines by sacrificing cross-chunk visibility of
blending voxels;

## Notes for nerds
* The game’s source code and CMake scripts have been re-done to utilize
precompiled headers; this single-handedly sped build times up to five times the
previous speed. The entire project (WITH ALL THE DEPENDENCIES including
FetchContent’ed GLFW) takes about 41 seconds to build!  

## What's next
* Lua support, I guess? I’d love to have at least some interactivity in the
console and support for some plugins that don’t mess with the game itself too
much. It’s not like I want a Luanti clone;  
* Liquids, I guess? I’d really like to try my hand at doing this;  
* Actual good surface feature generation; I really want to do that. These
pillars are getting annoying;
