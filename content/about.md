Hello there! My name is Kirill ([or Cyril, it depends](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril); though I prefer the Russian pronounciation for _obvious reasons_ and would prefer others to use it as well) and I like programming... As a matter of fact, the art of programming has been my passion for 7+ years and thanks to a couple of connections, a job that pays my bills for over a year!
