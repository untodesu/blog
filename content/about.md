Hello there! My name is Kirill ([yes, really](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirill)) and I like programming... As a matter of fact, the art of programming has been my passion for 7+ years and thanks to a couple of connections, a job that pays my bills for over a year!  

## My projects
- <img class="emoji" src="about/vclient.png"/> [Voxelius](https://github.com/untodesu/voxelius): a Minecraft clone made with C++ and OpenGL;  
- <img class="emoji" src="about/riteg.png"/> [RITEG](https://untodesu.github.io/riteg): a shader-based filter host application for my VHS filter;  
- <img class="emoji" src="about/sorse.png"/> [Refraction](https://github.com/untodesu/refraction): my vision of HL2's 20th anniversary update before the 20th anniversary update;  
- <img class="emoji" src="about/warning.png"/> [EAS](https://github.com/untodesu/eas): a Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) packet generator;  

## Funkytown spinner
> If you ever seen something spinning with a Funkytown playing in the background, you can be sure that the patient-zero, the T-posing demoknight spinning in the void, is my creation and I am not sorry for what I did!!!
